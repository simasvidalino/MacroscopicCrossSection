algorithm

1- interface

	1- Enter the number of region
	2- Chose isotopes and reactions per regions
	3- Chose Endf File (browse or web)
	4- Save number of regions and Endf file because in 3- the file can have more isotopes than I need


2- WebScraping
	
	1- Receive the isotopes names and their reactions
	2- Enter the website, put texts and choose just Endf library. After, select all and click on retrieve. Get text

3- Shell
	
	1- Get the file name from interface
	2- Verify if there is a Njoy21 dir, if not, execute installNjo21.sh
	3- Create input file Njoy or use one 
	4- Execute .\njoy21 -i (fale name from 1) -o output

4- filter

	After step 3, a question: would it make sense just one material with differents material zones to received more than one type of incident particle?
	*The first ideia is let the user enter with all reactions and to calculate.
	*The second ideia is chose material per region and put the reaction as a default.

	1- Receive the informations about regions (isotopes per region)
	2- Pick all isotopes per region together using a dictionary

        Scattering reation:

	[{Region1: {Material 1: reaction1 : []},...,{Material N: reaction1 : [], reaction2 : [], },...}

	Others reactions:
	[{Region1: {Material 1: [reaction1 : [], ... , reactionN : []], ... , Material N: [reaction1 : [], ... , reactionN : []]}}, {Region2: {Material 1: [reaction1 : [], ... , reactionN : []], ... , Material N: [reaction1 : [], ... , reactionN : []]}}]
	

5- Calculate macroscopic cross section

	1- Transform expoent from njoy into a number that can be read for python
	2- Calculate the dates and make a outputfile with Jesus's format (my professor)
